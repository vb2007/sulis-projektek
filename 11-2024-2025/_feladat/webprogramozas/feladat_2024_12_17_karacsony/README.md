# Christmas Market

> You and your friends are holding a Christmas Market. Your task is to create a website for it based on the provided example.

**Read all tasks before starting your work!**

## Tasks

1. Copy the provided `index.html` file and `images` folder into your working directory.

2. Create a `css` folder and then create a `style.css` file. 

3. Recreate the website that is found in the `samples` folder. It doesn't have to be perfect, just look similar.

    - Create the HTML file structure and format it in the CSS file. Put your name in the footer after "Made by".

    - Try using semantic HTML elements, but using divs is also okay. 

    - Follow all HTML and CSS standards and specifications. Avoid redundant code.

    - Make your code easily readable, editable and expandable!

    - The following breakpoints were used when creating the website: `650px` and `1000px`. Please note that the samples do not reflect these breakpoints.

    - Avoid using tables for the layout, use flexboxes and grids instead.

    - The buttons don't need to work, except the ones in the navigation bar.

    - Try using relative mesurments such as `rem` or `em`, but using pixels is also okay.

    - The background is `#fff7ed` and the red used is `#d6001c`. Try using variables for more efficent work.

    - Consider using the mobile-first approach.

4. Present your work to your teacher at the end of the class.

5. Upload your work to the Moodle course, so your teacher can take a closer look at it.

## Bonus Tasks

- Create a git repository for your project! (GitHub or GitLab)

- Commit your work after completing bits of the website! Make sure the commit messages reflect the work you've done. Don't forget to push!

- Add your teacher to the git repository and upload the link to the Moodle course!
